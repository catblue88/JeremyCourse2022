## JeremyCourse2022
 is my notes and some resources saved due to my following 2022 session of Jeremy Howard's 2022 edition of
# Practical Deep Learning for Coders
#### apart from some links below :
1. [course main web page](https://course.fast.ai/),
2. [and Jeremy's public resources on Kagle](https://www.kaggle.com/jhoward/code?userId=3256&sortBy=dateCreated&tab=profile),
3. [super helpful course forum](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSgU6S_3l6pX-4hQYKNJZFU),
4. [live coding sessions on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM),
5. [eventually Jeremy's wonderful textbook in notebook form](https://github.dev/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/01_intro.ipynb).  
#### I hope to save some notes of mine below together with my attempts to experiment on the brilliant Jupyter notebooks provided for each lesson.  
**_NOTE:_**  So finger's crossed that this time I will reach successfully the end of the Course!
