## JeremyCourse2022
 is my notes and some resources saved due to my following 2022 session of Jeremy Howard's 2022 edition of
# Practical Deep Learning for Coders
#### apart from some links:
1. [course main web page](https://course.fast.ai/),
2. [and Jeremy's public resources on Kagle](https://www.kaggle.com/jhoward/code?userId=3256&sortBy=dateCreated&tab=profile),
3. [super helpful course forum](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSgU6S_3l6pX-4hQYKNJZFU),
4. [live coding sessions on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM),  
I hope to save some notes of mine below together with my attempts to experiment on the brilliant Jupyter notebooks provided for each lesson
... So finger's crossed that this time I will reach successfully the end of the Course!
